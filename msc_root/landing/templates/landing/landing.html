<h1>Welcome to the Munro Step Challenge - Team Challenge 2022 </h1>

<p>Our fifth team challenge is underway and we're hoping to make it our best yet.</p>
<p>Our Goal: 450 Million steps together in September (for teams wanting the extra challenge thatâ€™s at least 50 million steps per team)</p>
<p>The Reason:  September is  Blood Cancer Awareness Month so we are raising awareness and funds for Blood Cancer UK. They really appreciate our enthusiasm and support.</p>
<b><em>So, are we ready!?!</em></b>

<p>~Mike and Cheryl</p>
