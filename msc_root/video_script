Hello Peakers! Cheryl and I can't join you now, but we wanted to be part of this celebration. The 2023 Munro Step Challenge is done,
and the Team Step Challenge comes to an end tonight. 
We are happy that the Team Step Challenge has become something we all look forward to, and are touched by how appreciative people are for the 
setup we do. We try and make each year the best yet.

How did this year do?  This year we had 1,387 peakers log steps, representing 88 ambassador groups. As of this afternoon, we had stepped 438 million steps, which is 88% of our ultimate goal of 500 million.  Looking at the Just Giving pages, we have raised 16,880 pounds, which is $20,600 or 19,435 euros.

We are glad everyone had fun. Let's keep talking about any ideas to make next year's smoother, better and cooler!
<Cheryl>  
See you this spring!
