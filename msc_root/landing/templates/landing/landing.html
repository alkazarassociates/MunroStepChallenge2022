<h1>Welcome to the Munro Step Challenge - Team Challenge 2022 </h1>
  <p>This is our fifth team challenge and we're hoping to make it our best yet.
  We have our own website this year for one-stop shopping - registration, daily input, reports, FAQ.</p> 
  <p>Once again 8 Super Teams of peakers will work together to complete this year's "Walk around the World" challenge.  There'll be some friendly team competition too.</p>
  <p>And remember - we are doing this for Blood Cancer Awareness Month and to help Blood Cancer UK. They really appreciate our enthusiasm and support.</p>
  <p><b><i>So, are we ready to break that billion step count together this year!?!</i></b></p>
  <p>~Mike and Cheryl</p>
