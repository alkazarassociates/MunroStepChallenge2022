    Greetings, MPC Ambasador Group Administrators!
    
    <p>When Peakers register for the Team Challenge, they will be assigned to one of eight <b>Teams</b>. If you add 
    your <em>Ambassador Group</em> to our list now, Peakers can choose to register as a member of your group, and we
    will do our best to put all such members on the same Team.</p>

    <p>We will do our best to answer questions and fix problems that arise, but this will work best if, by signing up, 
    you agree to help your members when they have the kind of trouble you can help with--translating instructions,
    walking through web navigation, etc. just the way that Ambassador admins always help their members!</p>
