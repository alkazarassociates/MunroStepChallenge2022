<h1>Welcome to the Munro Step Challenge - Team Challenge 2022 </h1>
  <p>This is our fifth team challenge and we're hoping to make it our best yet.
  We have our own website (and database) this year for one-stop shopping - registration, daily input, reports, FAQ.</p> 
  <p>Once again 8 super teams comprised of ambassador group members and individual peakers will work together to complete this year's "Walk around the World" challenge. There'll be some friendly team competition too.
  And remember - we are doing this for Blood Cancer Awareness Month and to help Blood Cancer UK. They really appreciates our enthusiasm and support.</p>
  <p><b><i>So, are we ready to break that billion step count together this year!?!</i></b></p>
